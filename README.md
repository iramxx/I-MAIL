# I-Mail App

## The Idea of the Project
Mail App is a web-based email client that allows users to send, receive, and manage emails in a modern and responsive interface. The application uses asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX) to create a seamless single-page experience where users can navigate between mailboxes and compose messages without full page reloads.

## The Features
- Send and receive emails with subject, body, and recipients
- View emails in Inbox, Sent, and Archive folders
- Archive and unarchive messages
- Read full email details, including timestamps and sender info
- Reply to messages with the original content and subject line pre-filled
- Compose form with real-time submission and UI update
- Fully dynamic front-end using JavaScript fetch and DOM manipulation
- RESTful API built with Django on the backend

## What I Have Learned
- Built and consumed a REST API using Django
- Used the Fetch API and JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations
- Implemented dynamic page transitions and state updates without reloading
- Practiced advanced DOM manipulation and event handling
- Gained experience combining Django with a JavaScript-based front-end
- Improved understanding of single-page application behavior without using frontend frameworks
